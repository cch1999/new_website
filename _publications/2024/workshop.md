  In the benchmark, we implement numerous featurisation schemes, datasets for self-supervised pre-training and downstream evaluation, pre-training tasks, and auxiliary tasks. The benchmark can be used as a working template for a protein representation learning research project, a library of drop-in components for use in your projects, or as a CLI tool for quickly running protein representation learning evaluation and pre-training configurations.
