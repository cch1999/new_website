                Feel free to ignore this page if you are not interested in my aviation activities.

                I hold a UK SLP (Sailplane Pilots License), Full Silver Badge and a Gold Distance (300km solo flight).

                I also occasionally compete in competetions and have come first in the UK Interuniversity Gliding Competetion (for Best Technical Soaring Flight) and the Oxford-Cambridge Varity. I also competed in the UK Junior Gliding Nationals 2023 (but did not come first...).
