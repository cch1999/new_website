                Feel free to ignore this page if you are not interested in my aviation activities.
                <br><br>

                I hold a UK SLP (Sailplane Pilots License), Full Silver Badge and a Gold Distance (300km solo flight) and I am an active member of both Lasham and Cambridge Gliding Clubs.
                <br><br>

                I also occasionally compete in competitions and have come first in the UK Interuniversity Gliding Competition (for Best Technical Soaring Flight) and the Oxford-Cambridge Varsity. I also competed in the UK Junior Gliding Nationals 2023 (but did not come first...). Feel free to reach out directly for any questions or opportunities relating to aviation.
